# Lesson 4: Block Patterns

Block Patterns are a great way to get up and running quickly when editing a page in WordPress. They allow you to insert entire predefined templates so that you don't have to start from scratch. As an editor you get a really nice visual preview of what the pattern looks like.

## What are "block patterns"?

Patterns are commonly used sections of a design. If you for example have a Pricing table that should normally be used with a heading above and a full width colored background that would make a perfect pattern.

You can also put entire Page layouts into block patterns to really get someone up and running quickly which might be useful for projects where the editors commonly need to create similar types of landing pages for example.

In general they are best suited for predefined sections in a page.

## Exercise Overview

10up has a lot of clients in higher-ed. These clients obviously devote a lot of attention to the student application process. Imagine you're working with one of these clients and they want to re-purpose the work we did on the CTA block from [Lesson 1](02-cta-lesson.md). On most pages, they want to include this pattern of blocks: a heading, a description and two CTA blocks side by side. Here's what they want:

!["Block Variation, CTA block"](/img/variations-block-cta-1.png)

We need a way to "package up" all those elements so editors can easily insert it whenever they want. Thankfully we can, with block patterns!

## Breaking it Down

For our example, we need to combine these four blocks for easy use in the editor. Let's break down what we're looking at here into actual blocks:

!["Block Variation breakdown"](/img/variations-block-cta-2.png)

On first glance, it looked like we just needed 4 blocks. But we actually need a couple of more for wrapping. Here's the breakdown:

1. A Group block to contain the whole thing
2. A Heading block
3. A Paragraph block
4. A Columns block to contain our CTA blocks
5. Our two CTA blocks
