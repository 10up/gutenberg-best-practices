## What are "block patterns"?

Patterns are commonly used sections of a design. If you for example have a Pricing table that should normally be used with a heading above and a full width colored background that would make a perfect pattern.

You can also put entire Page layouts into block patterns to really get someone up and running quickly which might be useful for projects where the editors commonly need to create similar types of landing pages for example.

In general they are best suited for predefined sections in a page.
