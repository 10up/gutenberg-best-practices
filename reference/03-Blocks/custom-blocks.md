# Custom Blocks

WordPress itself comes with a whole bunch of build in _"core"_ blocks. These blocks are build to be flexible, and are meant to allow you to build any layout you want. 

However these goals the core blocks have may not always align with the goals you have for the client you are building a site for. Or there may be integrations that straight up are not possible. 

This is where the block editor allows you to build your own custom blocks.
