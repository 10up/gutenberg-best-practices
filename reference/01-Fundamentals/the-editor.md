The editor is the main interface through which one interacts with their website. It is the gateway through which you can share your message with the world. So the editorial experience is essential in creating a pleasant supportive experience that allows you to focus just on what you want to share.

There are several different instances of the editor throughout the WordPress admin interface. The most common one being the **post editor**. it is what you are probably thinking of straight away. The post editor is where you create new or edit posts/pages or any other custom post type.

But there are also other instances of the block editor being used throughout the admin interface. There is the site editor also reffered to as the template editor which was introduced in WordPress 5.8 as the first piece of the full-site-editing project. Finally, for now, there is the widget editor which now also runs powered by the block editor.

## Anatomy of the Block Editor
No matter which instance of the editor you are working with the fundamental anatomy always stays the same. There always is the main editing canvas, a top toolbar and a settings sidebar on the side.
